Despite of this, Linus Torvalds,\nauthor of the word processor Linux with which the SAG was written, is\nnot worried.  ``We\'ll have world domination real soon now, anyway,\'\' he\nexplains, ``for 1.4 at the lastest.\'\'\n	...\n		-- Lars Wirzenius <wirzeniu@cs.helsinki.fi>\n		   [comp.os.linux.announce]\n'),

Circum-\nstances being what they were, neither admission could be of any benefit.\nSilence, though, could.  It was in the days of the rains that their prayers\nwent up, not from the fingering of knotted prayer cords or the spinning of\nprayer wheels, but from the great pray-machine in the monastery of Ratri,\ngoddess of the Night.  The high-frequency prayers were directed upward through\nthe atmosphere and out beyond it, passing into that golden cloud called the\nBridge of the Gods, which circles the entire world, is seen as a bronze\nrainbow at night and is the place where the red sun becomes orange at midday.\nSome of the monks doubted the orthodoxy of this prayer technique...\n		-- Roger Zelazny, \"Lord of Light\"\n'),

This is true in religion as\nit is in politics, and is self-evident to all except fanatics and the naive.\nAs for the fanatics, whose number is legion in our own time, we might be\nadvised to leave them to heaven.  They will not, unfortunately, do us the\nsame courtesy.  They attack us and each other, and whatever their\nprotestations to peaceful intent, the bloody record of history makes clear\nthat they are easily disposed to restore to the sword.  My own belief in\nGod, then, is just that -- a matter of belief, not knowledge.  My respect\nfor Jesus Christ arises from the fact that He seems to have been the\nmost virtuous inhabitant of Planet Earth.  But even well-educated Christians\nare frustrated in their thirst for certainty about the beloved figure\nof Jesus because of the undeniable ambiguity of the scriptural record.\nSuch ambiguity is not apparent to children or fanatics, but every\nrecognized Bible scholar is perfectly aware of it.  Some Christians, alas,\nresort to formal lying to obscure such reality.\n- Steve Allen, comedian, from an essay in the book \"The Courage of\n  Conviction\", edited by Philip Berman\n'),
